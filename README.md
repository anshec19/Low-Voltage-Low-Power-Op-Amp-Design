# Low-Voltage-Low-Power-Op-Amp-Design
This project focuses on designing a low-voltage, low-power operational amplifier using composite cascode architecture and indirect feedback compensation. The design leverages subthreshold operation to minimize power consumption, making it suitable for applications like ECG signal amplification.
